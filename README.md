# Generic Fan Coil Thermostat

A Home Assistant integration for controlling fan coil thermostats. Compatible with HACS.

## Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/generic_fan_coil_thermostat` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Configure via UI or YAML.

## HACS

This repository is compatible with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). Add it as a custom repository in HACS for easy updates.

## Documentation

See [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/yourusername/generic_fan_coil_thermostat).

## Features

- Works as a standard Home Assistant climate entity
- Automatically controls fan speed based on temperature difference
- Controls additional switches when heating or cooling is needed (e.g., heat exchangers, pumps, heating elements)
- Supports both automatic and manual fan speed control
- Supports heating, cooling, or both modes depending on configured switches
- Configurable through the UI
- Works with any fan entity that supports preset modes

## Configuration

During setup, you'll need to provide:

- Temperature sensor entity to use for monitoring room temperature
- Fan entity to control (must support preset modes: low, medium, high)
- Optional cooling switches (e.g., heat exchanger switches, pump controls) - these will be turned on when cooling is active
- Optional heating switches (e.g., heating elements, boiler controls) - these will be turned on when heating is active
- Optional temperature settings (min, max, default target, step size)

**Note:** The thermostat will only show heating and/or cooling modes if the corresponding switches are configured. If no switches are configured, both heating and cooling modes will be available for fan-only operation.

## Usage

Once installed, the Generic Fan Coil Thermostat will appear as a climate entity that you can add to your dashboards using any of the standard climate cards.

- Set the target temperature like any other thermostat
- Switch between "Off", "Heat", and "Cool" modes (available modes depend on configured switches)
- Select fan mode: auto, off, low, medium, or high
  - In "auto" mode, the fan speed is controlled automatically based on temperature difference
  - In manual modes (off, low, medium, high), the fan stays at the selected speed regardless of temperature
  - When thermostat mode is "Off", switches are turned off but fan remains in its current state if manually controlled
- Heating and cooling switches are controlled automatically based on demand, regardless of fan mode

## Fan Speed Control Logic

### Cooling Mode
- Temperature difference < 0.5°C: Fan OFF, Cooling switches OFF
- Temperature difference 0.5-1.5°C: Fan LOW, Cooling switches ON
- Temperature difference 1.5-2.5°C: Fan MEDIUM, Cooling switches ON
- Temperature difference > 2.5°C: Fan HIGH, Cooling switches ON

### Heating Mode
- Temperature difference < -0.5°C: Fan OFF, Heating switches OFF
- Temperature difference -0.5°C to -1.5°C: Fan LOW, Heating switches ON
- Temperature difference -1.5°C to -2.5°C: Fan MEDIUM, Heating switches ON
- Temperature difference < -2.5°C: Fan HIGH, Heating switches ON

*Temperature difference = Current Temperature - Target Temperature*

## Example Use Cases

### For Cooling Switches
- Heat exchanger controls for water cooling systems
- Water pumps for cooling circuits
- Valve actuators for cooling water flow
- Additional cooling equipment like chillers
- Any switch that needs to be active during cooling operation

### For Heating Switches
- Heating elements or electric heaters
- Boiler or heating system controls
- Water pumps for heating circuits
- Valve actuators for heating water flow
- Underfloor heating controls
- Any switch that needs to be active during heating operation
